Exercise 5.1

Initially set N to the value for which you want to work out the factorial.

See ex5_factorial.svg for data paths.

See ex5_factorial_controller.svg for controller.

P contains the answer.


Note: another way to approach this would be to require the user to initially
set the P and C registers to 1 manually, rather than include the instructions
as part of the data paths and controller. I'm not sure what is the preferred
method.
