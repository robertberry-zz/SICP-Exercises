# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs exercises

These are my answers to the SICP exercises.

I use Common Lisp for most of them, because I like programming in
SLIME/Emacs. When I have to I've dropped into Scheme (e.g. for the picture
language that DrRacket provides for 2.2.4).

I cannot promise all of these are the correct answers, but I've tried to
indicate where and when I feel I'm unsure about something.
