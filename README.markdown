# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs exercises

These are my answers to the SICP exercises. I've used Common Lisp instead of
Scheme. They're pretty much equivalent, apart from the Lisp-1/Lisp-2 thing, so
whatever.

I can't promise all of these are accurate or even complete. I sometimes skip
ahead and leave myself TODOs to go back to when I'm finding a question a bit
confusing / difficult. Once I've made my way through the whole thing I'm going
to go back and fill in the gaps.
